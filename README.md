# Blockchain, DLT, and Decentralized Applications – Lab Course (Prof. Luca Spalazzi)

This repository hosts the lab materials for the **Blockchain, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and Decentralized Applications** course.  
All students will have open access to code examples, exercises, and tasks.

## Course Overview
The course introduces the foundations and practice of decentralized technologies.  
We will study:
- Blockchain architectures and consensus mechanisms  
- Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps)  
- Solidity programming for Ethereum-compatible platforms  
- Development and testing tools (Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, Ganache, Metamask, etc.)  

## Structure
Each lab includes:
1. **Examples** – step-by-step guided code and demonstrations  
2. **Exercises** – short practice problems to reinforce concepts  
3. **Tasks** – assignments to be completed and submitted
